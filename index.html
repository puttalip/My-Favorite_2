          <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My favorite hobby is reading because whenever I open a new book, it takes me to an entirely different world. It's filled with fantasies and adenture. I can also read a book anytime and anywhere. They are very easy to carry. They also help me cope with my feelings. Whenever I am sad, angry or overexcited, I try to read a book I haven't read in a long time too calm me down or cheer me up. This is why reading is my favorite hobby.</p>
